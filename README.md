I love musicals and wanted to put some of my favorites on display in this trivia game. If you are a Broadway enthusiast you'll probably have no trouble getting all of these questions correct, but the intended audience was people who aren't very familiar with show tunes, so I tried to make the questions easier to guess based on contextual content.

It's a timed quiz that gives you your score sheet at the end. I could've made questions for this for days, but in order to make it so my instructors could see the game play in a relatively short time, I limited myself to 7 questions. Hope you enjoy it!
